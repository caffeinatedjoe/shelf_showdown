# Shelf Showdown: Book Ranking Tool

## Project Goal

The goal of Shelf Showdown is to build a user-friendly book ranking tool that allows users to import a list of books and determine their personal ranking through pairwise comparisons. This tool will help users organize their reading preferences by systematically comparing books against each other to produce a fully ranked list with relative scores.

## Key Features

- **Book Import**: Users can import a list of books from various sources (e.g., CSV, manual entry, or API integrations).
- **Pairwise Comparisons**: An interactive interface for users to compare books two at a time, selecting preferences in each matchup.
- **Ranking Algorithm**: Utilize a ranking algorithm (such as Elo or Bradley-Terry) to calculate relative scores based on comparison outcomes.
- **Ranked Output**: Generate a complete ranked list of books with associated scores, allowing users to see their top picks and relative standings.
- **User Interface**: A clean, intuitive web or desktop application for easy interaction.

## Design Principles

- **Mobile-First Approach**: The application is designed with a mobile-first mindset, prioritizing usability and aesthetics on mobile devices while ensuring it works seamlessly and looks great on desktop.
- **Neumorphism Style**: Use neumorphism, a design trend that creates soft, inset buttons and elements appearing embedded in or raised from the background using subtle shadows, highlights, and gradients for a tactile, modern look.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Data Persistence: localStorage or IndexedDB
- Algorithm: Pairwise comparison ranking system

## Development Roadmap

1. Define requirements and design architecture
2. Implement book import functionality
3. Build pairwise comparison interface
4. Integrate ranking algorithm
5. Create output and visualization features
6. Testing and refinement

This project will be built collaboratively, iterating on features and improvements as we progress.
